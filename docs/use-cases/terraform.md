# Unleash the power of infrastructure as code

Terraform is a powerful tool that allows you to manage your infrastructure as code (IaC), version it, and collaborate with your team. But managing infrastructure changes can be complex, especially when working with multiple teams and systems.

Some teams run Terraform automation locally using wrapper scripts to establish a consistent working environment. For example, enforcing specific naming conventions, or managing Terraform state files in a centralised location. This brings its own challenges of visibility, traceability, consistency, security, and auditability requirements.

Using Terraform with OpsChain ensures that DevOps engineers no longer need to run Terraform on their local machines. With OpsChain, Terraform can be run in a centralised environment, such as a dedicated server or a cloud-based instance. This can free up resources on the local machines of DevOps engineers, and provide a more secure and consistent environment for running Terraform.

Running Terraform from OpsChain offers a comprehensive solution for automating Terraform as with OpsChain, you can:

- automate Terraform runs
- allow for human approval
- ensure compliance with your organisation's change management policies
- monitor the status of your Terraform changes in real-time
- integrate with other tools and systems such as version control systems and issue trackers

Terraform and OpsChain are a perfect match. With OpsChain, you can manage your Terraform changes with confidence, knowing that your infrastructure is in good hands. In addition, with the ability to integrate with other tools you can simplify the delivery pipeline even further.
