## Web GUI new features

![](/img/undraw-done.png)

In our December 2023 update, we're excited to unveil new features that significantly enhance the OpsChain Web GUI. We've refined the GUI for more intuitive interactions, and expanding functionality for comprehensive project and environment management. These enhancements are not just about adding new features; they enrich the user experience, making every step more efficient, transparent, and accessible.

Authorised users can now explore:

### Change creation

You can now easily create OpsChain changes within the GUI. This new feature is an alternative to using the CLI, making the workflow initiation more accessible and user-friendly.

### Human approvals

- Receive intuitive popup notifications for changes awaiting human approval, ensuring that important changes awaiting review and approval never miss your attention.
- The ability to approve or reject a change, including specifying a comment. This streamlines the workflow process by allowing authorised users to determine whether the change can proceed whilst also allowing for the capture relevent details.

### Wait steps

Comments can now be entered when continuing a wait step providing the capability to capture pertinent information.

### Data export

- Download change logs with ease, enhancing your ability to review and distribute logs easily.
- Our new CSV export feature allows for more efficient data analysis and reporting, accommodating the exporting of lists for projects, environments, automated changes etc.

### Project & Environment management

- Keep your OpsChain organised and current with our new archiving option for projects and environments.
- The ability to now create and view the project Git remotes directly within the GUI. This provides more transparency as to the underlying source of truth for project actions.

Your feedback is a vital part of our growth. Please share your thoughts or suggestions on these latest updatesâ€”we're listening!
