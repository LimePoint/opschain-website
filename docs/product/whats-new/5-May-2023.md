## Access step logs

![view stop log](/img/view-step-log.png)

In addition to being able to access the entire change logs, OpsChain now allows you to dive deeper into your workflows with the ability to view individual step logs. This feature provides you with real-time, detailed information on each step making it easier to understand and troubleshoot issues.

You can now view granular details on each step of a change, including timestamps, execution status, and log messages.

This allows you to:

- easily and quickly identify bottlenecks, errors, or inefficiencies in your change process
- optimise your workflow by understanding which steps require adjustments or improvements
