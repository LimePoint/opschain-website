In this video, we'll define our first action within OpsChain, which we've named `echo`. The purpose of the `echo` action is to output the context in which the action is executed - specifically, the project and environment names.

Actions in OpsChain are tasks that can be performed within an environment. They consist of one or more steps and may have prerequisites. They serve as fundamental building blocks within OpsChain, and can be combined into complex workflows to cater to your specific needs.

We'll demonstrate how to define the _'echo'_ action using OpsChain's domain-specific language (DSL). This will provide a practical understanding of how actions are defined within the OpsChain system. Let's dive in and see how it's done.
