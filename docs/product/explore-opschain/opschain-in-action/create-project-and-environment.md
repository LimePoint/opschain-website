Below we demonstrate how to simply create projects and environments within OpsChain. In OpsChain, projects are used to organise environments and changes.

Each project has:

- remote Git repositories containing configuration for that project - e.g. hosted on GitHub, Bitbucket, or elsewhere
- properties where you can store project specific configuration items such a key-value pairs, environment variables and files â€“ more on properties later ðŸ™‚
- secrets where you can store sensitive data such as access credentials or private SSH keys
