Within OpsChain, a change refers to the execution of a specific action within a given environment, using a particular Git revision. The video below demonstrates this concept by creating a change which executes an action named _'echo'_. This action is designed to display the project name and the environment name, reflecting the context in which the change is running.

For this demonstration, we will use the latest commit revision in the master branch to deploy this change. The deployment will be carried out in both the dev, test, and prod environments using OpsChain. We will also query the change history for each environment enabling us to view what has occurred.

This example provides a practical understanding of how changes are executed and queried using the OpsChain CLI.
