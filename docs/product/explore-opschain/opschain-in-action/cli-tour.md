In this tour, we'll be exploring the command line interface (CLI) of OpsChain. We'll run through an overview of some of the key commands that you can use for managing a project, handling an environment, and monitoring a change.

One of the powerful features of the CLI is its built-in help system. For every command, help is readily available, providing a description to assist with understanding.
