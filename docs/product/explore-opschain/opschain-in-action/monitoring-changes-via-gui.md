In this demonstration, we'll guide you through monitoring a running change using OpsChain's web GUI. Specifically, we'll be tracking the deployment of a Confluent Platform environment.

You'll witness how the change list dynamically updates in real-time, offering a live view of the status of both historical and ongoing processes.

We'll then select a running change to delve deeper. In the change details, you'll see the steps involved in the change, represented in a tree structure that denotes parent and child steps. This tree updates in real-time, reflecting the ongoing activity, execution time, and status.

Furthermore, we'll demonstrate how to access the logs for both the change and individual steps. These features, combined with the step tree, provide a comprehensive view of the change, enabling detailed tracking, troubleshooting, and analysis.
