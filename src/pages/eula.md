# LimePoint End User Licence Agreement (EULA)

This agreement applies to software products and services
(including without limitation MintPress, DriftGuard and OpsChain),
and all associated Documentation, developed, maintained or
distributed by LimePoint Pty Ltd ABN 35 618 454 827 an
Australian company (**LimePoint**) (together the **Products**).

*<u>This agreement</u>*

This agreement sets out the terms of a contract between you and
LimePoint under which you may access and use the Products. **By
downloading, accessing or using the Products, you agree
to be bound by this agreement.**

LimePoint may make some or all of the Products available to you
free, under a trial licence or subject to the payment of fees. You
(or the Licensee) may need to create an account in order to be
able to download or access some Products. If you register a
company or other entity as a Licensee, you do so as their agent
or authorised representative (and bind them to this agreement)
and represent and warrant that you have the authority to do so.
You (or the Licensee) are responsible for keeping your account
information up to date and are responsible for any actions taken
using your account details.

**If you have subscribed for a free trial of any Products that
are subject to fees, you may only use the relevant Product
in accordance with the terms made available to you at the
commencement of the trial and you may be charged fees if
you continue using the Products after the free trial ends or
if you do not comply with the terms of the trial.**

This agreement is supplemented by, and incorporates, any
additional terms made available to you by LimePoint at the time
of providing the Products to you (including any order agreed by
you (or the Licensee) and LimePoint in writing or any applicable
click wrap terms) (the **Order**) and documents incorporated by
reference (including the Documentation and any applicable
Acceptable Use Policy). Unless specifically stated otherwise, in the
event of an inconsistency between an Order, this agreement and
any document incorporated by reference, those documents will be
interpreted in that order of precedence.

*<u>Updates to these terms</u>*

**LimePoint may update this EULA at any time.** However,
unless agreed otherwise in an Order the most recent version of
this EULA will apply to any Order, when you download any
Product and from the commencement of any Further Term and
unless set out below changes in the EULA during any Committed
Term will not apply to you.

If LimePoint is providing you Products on a SaaS Basis, LimePoint
may change the terms by providing 30 days notice (or
immediately if the change is required by law), and if you do not
agree to the change you may terminate the relevant Order
(provided you do so within 30 days) and LimePoint will refund a
pro-rata proportion of any prepaid fees (provided you have given
LimePoint notice of your intention to terminate and 10 days to
withdraw or defer the change).

If you are using any Products that are not subject to fees or a
specific Order, you agree to check the most current EULA
annually and the most current version of the EULA will apply to
any further developments or use after each anniversary of the
date you downloaded the Product.

for the Term (the Licence) for the limited purpose of using the
Products for the purposes set out in the applicable Documentation
and environments specified in the Order (or if not specified in an

your (or the Licensee’s) own internal business purposes). You

than as set out in this agreement.

## 4 PROVISION OF PRODUCTS

LimePoint will:
(a) provide you with access to the Products for the Term
(including, where applicable, the provision of unique
usernames and passwords for each End User, or the
capability for the Licensee to do so in relation to its End
Users);
(b) ensure that the Products performs substantially in
accordance with the Documentation (including any service
levels specified in the Documentation); and
(c) in the event that the Order specifies that LimePoint will
provide a hosted solution, host the Products in accordance
with the Documentation and, if applicable, within the
jurisdiction specified in an Order.
If you are provided any Products on a SaaS Basis, while
LimePoint will generally provide prior notice, you acknowledge
and agree that LimePoint may update or change the Products at
any time.
LimePoint may subcontract delivery of its obligations under this
agreement but remains responsible for any act or omission of any
of its subcontractors.
LimePoint will provide some third party products together with
the Products. Those third party products are provided as is and
are subject to the relevant third party terms (refer to the relevant
Documentation), and LimePoint makes no warranties or
representations (whether express or implied) in relation to such
third party products.
Any User Enhancements are licenced subject to this agreement
and any additional conditions in the LimePoint Marketplace Rules.
Except to the extent set out in the LimePoint Marketplace Rules,
LimePoint disclaims all liability in respect of User Enhancements
and you use them at your own risk.

## 5 DOCUMENTATION

LimePoint will provide you with access to the Documentation
during the Term. You must not, without LimePoint's prior written
consent, make any alteration to the Documentation or provide
any Documentation to a person that is not an End User. You may
make such copies of the Documentation as are necessary for your
use of the Products in accordance with this agreement.

## 6 MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT

Subject to the Licensee paying any applicable maintenance and
support fees, LimePoint will provide:
(a) patches, updates and new releases for the Products that it
makes generally available to licensees of the Products that
are entitled to maintenance; and
(b) so long as you are an End User, you are entitled to access
LimePoint’s support services as set out in the
Documentation.
Despite the above, LimePoint is not required to make a new
release that is a substantial revision of the Products or any
additional functionality available to End Users and may require
the payment of additional fees before doing so.

## 7 FEES

Unless specified otherwise in the Order, the Licensee must pay
LimePoint the licence fees (if any):
(a) monthly in advance in the case of Products provided on a
SaaS Basis by allowing LimePoint to charge a credit card
provided by the Licensee or direct debit an account under a
direct debit authority provided by the Licensee in the
manner determined by LimePoint from time to time; or
(b) in all other cases annually in advance, and any additional
fees set out in the Order or this agreement, without
deduction, within 30 days of receipt of an invoice.
In the event that the Licensee requests an increase in any licence
limits set out in the Order for the balance of the then current
Term (or LimePoint detects that any licence limits have been
exceeded), LimePoint will issue an invoice to the Licensee for the
additional licences required. The licence fees applicable to any
additional licences will be set out in the Order or, if the fees are
not set out in the Order, LimePoint’s then current fees for the
licences shall apply.
Unless otherwise agreed the licence fees are fixed for the Initial
Term of this agreement and will then be LimePoint’s then current
licence fee for the Products for any Further Term. LimePoint
agrees to provide the Licensee with notice of the licence fees
applicable to any Further Term at least 45 days (or 10 days in the
case of a monthly subscription on a SaaS Basis) prior to the
expiry of the then current term. If LimePoint does not notify you,
the licence fee for the Further Term will be the same as the
licence fee for the then current term increased by an amount
reasonably determined by LimePoint to reflect any changes in the
Australian Consumer Price Index (Weighted Average Eight Capital
Cities) during that term.
If the Licensee disputes the whole, or any part of, an invoice, the
Licensee will pay the undisputed portion on the due date. If it is
subsequently resolved that the remainder is payable, the Licensee
will pay that amount together with interest at the rate of 10% per
annum (or if lower, the highest amount permitted by law)
calculated from the due date until the payment is made
(capitalising monthly).
Without limiting any other rights it may have, LimePoint may
suspend any licences granted under this agreement by written
notice to Licensee or, to the extent LimePoint is able to, limit
access of any End User to the Products until the Licensee has paid
any fees due.

## 8 TAXES

Except as otherwise expressly stated in the Order, all fees
payable under this agreement shall be exclusive of Tax, and you
will pay any Tax at the same time as any related payments under
clause 7 (or otherwise on demand by LimePoint). In the event
that you are required to withhold part of a payment to LimePoint
in respect of any applicable Taxes, you agree to gross up the
payment to LimePoint to the extent required to ensure that
LimePoint receives the originally intended payment in full.
Words and phrases defined in the GST Law have the same
meaning in this clause. If GST is payable on a Taxable Supply
made in connection with this agreement, the party providing the
Consideration for that Taxable Supply must also pay the GST
Amount as additional Consideration. This clause does not apply
to the extent that the Consideration for the Taxable Supply is
expressly agreed to be GST inclusive. No payment of any amount
pursuant to this agreement is required until the supplier has
provided a Tax Invoice or Adjustment Note as the case may be to
the recipient. Any reference in the calculation of Consideration or
of any indemnity, reimbursement or similar amount to a cost,
expense or other liability incurred by a party, must exclude the
amount of any Input Tax Credit entitlement of that party in
relation to the relevant cost, expense or other liability.

## 9 RESELLERS

(a) LimePoint has arrangements with authorised resellers who
facilitate the sale and implementation of the Products
(Resellers). Resellers have no capacity to make any
representations, give any warranties on behalf of, or
otherwise bind or act on behalf of, LimePoint. If a Reseller
gives opinions, representations or warranties in respect of
the Products, they do so in their own capacity. LimePoint
will only be bound by the Documentation provided by
LimePoint in respect of the Products.
(b) LimePoint will only be bound to the extent LimePoint has
expressly confirmed a representation, warranty or
undertaking in an Order. Any Order is a contract between
LimePoint and Licensee and unless otherwise agreed by
LimePoint in writing a Reseller is not a representative of
LimePoint.
(c) Licensee will only be deemed to have paid any amount to
LimePoint under this agreement via a Reseller to the extent
the Reseller pays that amount to LimePoint. Licensee
acknowledges and agrees that LimePoint may pay Resellers
commissions in relation to any Products.

(including any specified in the Documentation), you acknowledge and agree that the internet and Products of this nature are inherently vulnerable, and you acknowledge and agree that:

representations regarding the security of the Products and

of any security breach in relation to the Products.

## 12 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

You acknowledge that all Intellectual Property Rights in the
Products are retained by LimePoint. You acknowledge that
nothing in this agreement transfers or assigns to you any of
LimePoint's Intellectual Property Rights and your right to use and
access LimePoint’s Intellectual Property Rights are limited to the
operation and the use of the Products in accordance with this
agreement. You agree that your use of such Intellectual Property
Rights and any goodwill established thereby shall inure to the
exclusive benefit of LimePoint.
Without prejudice to your obligations under clause 10, you agree
that any derivatives, developments, enhancements or
modifications of the Products (including without limitation any
User Enhancements or any developments suggested or
contributed to by you, all files containing any part of the Products
created during the implementation and use of the Products) are
the property of LimePoint and you assign any present or future
Intellectual Property Rights that you might have in relation to
those developments to LimePoint and waive any Moral Rights that
you may have in relation to those developments (or to the extent
those rights cannot be waived, you consent to LimePoint’s use of
the developments in any manner that may otherwise infringe any
Moral Rights you have in relation to those developments).
Despite the above LimePoint wishes to encourage the use and
development of its Products and LimePoint:
(a) grants you a perpetual licence to use any User

continuing to pay any applicable fees (if any) for the
Products that the User Enhancements were derived from or
that are necessary to use those User Enhancements); and

Enhancements.

copyright, trade secret or other registered third party
Intellectual Property (IP Claim); and
(ii) pay any damages finally awarded against the
Indemnified Party or payable by the Indemnified Party
under a settlement approved by LimePoint.
(b) LimePoint may (at its option) modify or replace any
Infringing Items to ensure they are no longer “Infringing

functionality) or procure the rights for the Indemnified
Parties to use the Infringing Items. If either of those options
are not commercially viable for LimePoint, then if requested
by LimePoint, the Licensee must cease using and return the
Infringing Items to LimePoint and LimePoint will repay any

to by the use of the Products in breach of this
agreement, in a manner not contemplated in the
Documentation or in combination with another
product or software;

LimePoint acknowledges that Client Data remains the property of
the Licensee. Where LimePoint is providing the Products on a
SaaS Basis, LimePoint will provide you with the ability to upload,
access and download your Client Data, and will manage your

Documentation.
While LimePoint will use commercially reasonable endeavours to

is compelled by law to provide copies of your data or evidence
regarding your use of the Products to a third party regarding any
proceedings or investigations to which you are a party or subject
to.

the manner contemplated by the Documentation, it may not be
physically separated from the data of third parties.

(b) LimePoint may terminate this agreement or suspend your
access (or the access of any other End User) by written
notice to you if:
(i) an End User breaches a material obligation under
this agreement and fails to rectify that breach
within 10 Business Days of receiving a written
notice from LimePoint (the parties agree that a
breach of clauses 10, 12 or 19 relating to the
misuse, unauthorised copying or reverse
engineering of the Products is a material breach for
the purpose of this clause);
(ii) if the Licensee fails to pay any amount due to
LimePoint under this agreement or in connection
with any services relating to the Products;
(iii) you or the Licensee is subject to an Insolvency
Event;
(iv) an End User breaches clause 10.
(c) Where this agreement is terminated for LimePoint’s breach,
the Licensee may recover a pro-rata proportion of any
prepaid fees relating to the unexpired term. In all other
cases, unless expressly set out otherwise in this agreement,
LimePoint is entitled to retain any prepaid fees.
(d) On termination or expiry:
(i) unless stated otherwise in the Order, the Licensee
must pay any outstanding amounts owing to
LimePoint including, except in the case of
termination by the Licensee for LimePoint’s breach,
any fees referable to the balance of the then
current Term;
(ii) subject to your right to access Client Data after the
Term under clause 14, you must cease using the
Products and destroy or return all copies of the
Products, Documentation or LimePoint’s
Confidential Information on your systems or under
your control; and
(iii) if requested by the Licensee, LimePoint will
permanently delete your Client Data.
(e) Any termination of this agreement shall not affect any
accrued rights or liabilities of either party, nor shall it affect
any provision of this agreement which is expressly or by
implication intended to continue in force after such
termination, including clauses 1, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18,
19, 21, 22 and 23.

## 19 CONFIDENTIALITY

A party will not, without the prior written approval of the other
party, disclose the other party's Confidential Information. A party
will not be in breach of this clause in circumstances where it is
legally compelled (but not by contract) to disclose the other
party's Confidential Information.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause, a party may
disclose the terms of this agreement (other than Confidential
Information of a technical nature and Client Data) to its
employees, related companies, solicitors, auditors, insurers and
accountants provided that they give an undertaking to abide by
the terms of confidentiality imposed on the parties by this
agreement.
Each party acknowledges that damages alone are unlikely to be
an adequate remedy in respect of any breach of that party's
obligations under this clause. Accordingly, in addition to other
remedies that may be available, a Discloser may seek urgent
interlocutory relief to protect its rights and interest in its
Confidential Information against any actual or potential breach of
this clause by the Recipient, without proof of actual damages, in
addition to any other remedy to which the Discloser would be
entitled.
Unless you as us not to, you agree that LimePoint may make
reasonable reference to you as a customer in its marketing
materials.
